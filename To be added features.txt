Suggestions for Seller/Admin Improvements
1. Add Order Status Management (Critical)
Add an admin-side order status dropdown or action buttons in 
OrderManagement.jsx
 to transition orders: processing → shipped → delivered. This is the biggest gap — without it, orders get stuck at "processing" forever.

2. Add "Mark as Shipped" with Tracking
Combine the tracking info update with an automatic status change to shipped. Currently, the admin can add tracking info but the order status stays at processing.

3. Add Admin Dashboard/Summary View
Add order statistics to help the admin track:

How many orders are awaiting payment
How many are pending verification
How many have been shipped but not delivered
Revenue totals for completed orders

4. Customer Notification System
Implement notifications (email or in-app) for key events:

Payment proof declined (with remaining attempt count)
Payment verified
Order shipped (with tracking number)
Order about to be auto-cancelled (warning before the 48hr deadline)

[DONE] 5. Fix Stock Field Inconsistency
In 
declineOrderPayment
, change stock → availableStock when returning stock on the 3rd declined attempt, to match the field used everywhere else.

6. Add Admin Manual Cancel
Allow admin to manually cancel any order (with a reason) and automatically return stock. Currently, cancellation only happens via auto-expiry or 3 failed payment attempts.

7. Align Flowchart with Actual Timers
Update the flowchart to reflect the actual 5-minute reservation window instead of 48 hours, or decide if 48 hours is the desired behavior and update the code.

8. Add Intermediate Hold Phase
Before auto-cancelling at 48 hours, consider sending a reminder notification at, e.g., 24 hours, and updating order status to on_hold to give the customer one last chance.

9. Add Order History/Audit Log
Track all admin actions (verify, decline, ship, deliver) with timestamps for accountability and dispute resolution.

10. Delivery Confirmation
Consider adding a customer-side "Confirm Delivery" button that marks the order as delivered, or implement automatic delivery confirmation after a set period post-shipment.

1. When internet connection is poor, order is checked out and is stuck in the "Processing..." state > Customer went to another page or refreshed the browser > Order proceeded and got checked out. However, when I checked the My Reservations page, the same order was there, meaning the order got duplicated. Prevent this from happening and create a process across the whole store and admin panel that when the internet connection is poor, actions will either proceed or not. Make sure stocks will always tally. Think of the stocks as money that cannot be copied, like a centralized bank.


2. When experiencing internet connection issues, browser issues, database issues and other type of issue, I want the action to not proceed and redirect the users (whether admin or customer) back to the previous page/modal. 

[PENDING] 3. Create a Customer ID stored in the database for every unique customers

4. Add "Order Received" button from the customer's my-orders page. Possibly on the right side of See Order Details button.

5. Migrate uploaded images and change image storage from base64 to Firebase Storage.

6. Add loading state across all pages, containers, modals, when firebase data are still getting fetched. And a dash to input fields waiting to be filled.

7. Provide the Firestore live production rules. The most secured rules you can think of.

8. What can we do to minimize database read/write usage?

9. I'm concerned about the cost of using Firebase, what can we do to lower down the cost? I'm expecting more or less 5k visitors per day as an aggresive forecast with a $50 budget per month. Would this suffice? Any free image storage you can think of?

10. Duplicate "Reservation Expiring Soon" and "Reservation Expired" notifications.
