I recently requested for an improvement in my file. Below is the exact prompt:

I want you to make my invoice similar to the image attached. All business informations such as the Business Logo, Business Name, Address, Social Media Accounts, Contact Number, Payment Account Details, Terms and Conditions, Cancellation of Orders are to be provided by the admin via the Invoice tab in the Settings page. Please remove the Tax part in the invoice file and make the body future proof incase of hundreds of items in a single invoice. Changes should immediately reflect to PDF invoices.


Here's my sample:

PAYMENT TERMS:
Payment should be made within {insert allocated hour} hours upon checkout.

PAYMENT METHODS:
{Payment Method #1}
Account Name: {Account Name based on Firebase}
Account Number: {Account Number based on Firebase}

{Payment Method #2}
Account Name: {Account Name based on Firebase}
Account Number: {Account Number based on Firebase}

{Payment Method #3}
Account Name: {Account Name based on Firebase}
Account Number: {Account Number based on Firebase}

etc... (applicable with more than 3 payment accounts. Hide if none)


CANCELLATION OF ORDERS:
{Insert Business Name} offers no cancellation of orders upon checkout. However, you can opt to cancel this order by not arranging a payment within 48 hours.



The walkthrough snip was generated by Antigravity and a PDF Generator file has been created already i think. But still double check.

In the Invoice tab located on the side bar menu, I want you to add the below sub-menus:
1. Contents
